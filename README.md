# Augmented Reality Modeling Aid  

ARMA is a mobile app for Android, that can generate an augmented reality
model of the ATU (security space around the train) on the phone by targeting a
marker on the track. That way it provides an easy way to check the clearance of
the track after installations are made. The users can take screenshots and add
notes to it before including it in the documentation.
